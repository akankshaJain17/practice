To Do
1. implement a function which takes a limit M, and prints all the prime numbers from 1 to M

Array:
1. Given an array with N elements containing only 0s and 1s, sort them in a way that all 0s are to the left and 1s are to the right. For example: given array of 5 elements: arr = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0] => [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
 - Solve the above with runtime complexity of O(n) and O(1) memory space
 


DONE
-
